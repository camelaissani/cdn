### I'm Camel! ðŸ‘‹

I've been passionate about computer technologies for as long as I can remember, and with over a decade of experience, my enthusiasm for the field is as strong as ever. ðŸ’»ðŸš€

Throughout my journey in different software companies, I have always been interested in learning new technologies and languages.Â  These days, I mainly work in web application development, specializing in front-end, though Iâ€™m also skilled in back-end coding. I love creating websites that are intuitive, efficient, and truly useful for users.

Collaborating with others is a real driver for me. I enjoy bringing teammates together around shared ideas and delivering outstanding features to our customers.
